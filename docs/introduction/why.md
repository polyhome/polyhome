# Why

With well-established systems like Home Assistant or OpenHAB, you may be wondering why you should use PolyHome instead. If you are happy with how the others work, you may not need to switch to PolyHome. However the author of this project was simply not satisfied with different aspects, whether is be installation, documentation, or something completely else.

## The good

This project is being built with the mindset of doing it right the first time. As far as possible, no feature should be half-done once it is published, or have any known drawbacks that are within the realm of possibility to fix. In theory, this should lead to a product that _just works(tm)_

## The bad

When developing a product with the above aspirations, there will of course be some drawbacks. One of the biggest ones will be the feature-set. While we do strive to provide as many features, and support as many technologies as possible, we will most likely never reach the same amount of supported devices as other solutions in this space.

## The remaining

As you've now seen there are reasons for and against using PolyHome. It is now up to you to decide, whether the good outweighs the bad. If you have anything specific in mind, as to why you won't use this, please do open an issue over on [GitHub](https://github.com/polyhome/polyhome)
