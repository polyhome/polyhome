# Configuration

## Elements

An Element is what will actually show up in the UI. This can be something like a toggle button, a text field, or something completely else. This project utilises what is called Web Components, meaning that the sky is the limit!

In the navigation menu you will find a section dedicated to Elements.

## Commands

As mentioned Cards need a Command in order to do anything, other than just be shown. This is where a Command comes into play. A Command contains the low-level specific information about how an action should be executed, meaning this is also where it gets more technical.

Continuing the light analogy; let's say you turn your light on by sending an HTTP request to it. A Command is where you'd define the address the HTTP request needs to be sent, what params it might giving, headers, body etc.

In the navigation menu you can find an entire section dedicated to Commands.
