# Boards

## What is a Board?

Boards are the main component of the application. Before you set anything up, you should have at least one Board defined.

A Board can be thought of like a page in a guide. You have a lot of things that relate to each other, and makes sense to be shown on the same page.

## Examples

### Living Room

It's very common to have the most smart devices in your living room. Maybe you have some lights, your tv, an audio system. It would make sense to group these together on Board named "Living Room".

### Lights

Say that you have a lot of lights in your house, and you want easy access to all of them. Here it would make sense to make a Board containing all of the lights.
