# Elements

## What is an Element?

An Element is what is actually being shown on the screen. An Element can in fact be a lot of things, ranging from the official `ph-text-field` which is simply an Element showing some text, to `ph-toggle-btn` which is a toggle button containing a `toggle` trigger, which will send a request to the backend that it should toggle something. It may even be something more complex, like a calender or a TV remote.

Long story short, Elements are what brings the application to life. If you want to control your light, you will need an Element like a toggle button. If you want to control your TV, you will need an Element for that. While it may sound simple enough on the surface, this is one of the most complex things in PolyHome. Look in the navigation menu to find an answer for exactly what you are looking for.
