# Groups

Groups are what you will find inside of a Board. As the name suggests, this is a component where you're grouped things together. This might mean that you have a group consisting of all the lights in your house. Again, the freedom lies in your hands.

## What is a Group?

A Group is what you put inside of a Board. While a Board is what you would use to make big groups like a living room, or all your lights, a Group is what you would use to make a smaller grouping.

## Examples

### TV in living room

If you have a TV in your living room, you would most likely make a Group for that TV. It could contain buttons like power, volume, up, down etc. You would then use this Group inside of your Living Room Board.
