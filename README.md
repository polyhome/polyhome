# About the project

## What does it do?

PolyHome is a smarthome/home automation system. Aiming to be the go-to platform in regards to ease of use and extensibility. Want to control your lights from your phone? Easy. Want a system that aims to integrate with as many devices as possible? We got it.

It can be hard to describe exactly what PolyHome does, but here's the gist. Many other systems provide one of two things. Either you get an incredibly powerful system, with endless posibilities, or you get a system that's so easy to use and configure that even non-tech savvy people can do it. PolyHome aims to brings those two posibilities into one system.

## Is PolyHome the best choice?

Depends on what you are looking for. There are other solutions that have been on the market a lot longer, with a bigger community and more contributors. Where PolyHome differs is through the eyes of reliability and consistency.

Rather than always being on the absolute edge and pushing out new features constantly, PolyHome focuses on making the core product work, and work on new features when it logically makes sense to do so.
