# Introduction

## Thank you!

If you are looking at this with the intention of contributing, thank you! Maintaining an open source project is a great adventure, only made better by other people joining in.

## Guidelines

These guidelines have been put in place for two reasons. First and foremost it's to ensure everyone follows the same philosophy, and reduces discussions on how plans should be carried. As a consequence of this, and the second reason, contributing should be a more streamlined and enjoyable process.

## What contributions are we looking for

First thing you should note, is that this repository does not contain any code. You will find the code for the [frontend](https://github.com/polyhome/frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/polyhome/backend) in their respective repositories. So what is this repository for? First and foremost it's here in order to have a 'main' repository. When looking for the repository for an open source project, most people will look for a repo with the same name as the organisation, which is one of the purposes of this repo.

With that said, it does still contain important things like documentation! In the `docs` folder found in the root all the markdown is found for documentation. That is mostly the kind of stuff that needs contributions here: grammar and content. Whether you have something completely new to add, or just some simple grammar mistakes/typos, feel welcome to make a pull request.

# Ground Rules

## Expectations for contributions

### Behavioral

First and foremost there are some behavioral expectations, when it comes it interacting with the community. Sometimes contributions don't live up to the standards of the project. This is absolutely fine, and should be acknowledged.

Both as the one given the critique and the one recieving, remember to communicate in a respectable fashion, and do not resort to negative conversation. Take it as a learning opportunity. Read more about this in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
